I love learning new programming languages, but I'm not efficient at it.  It takes me _ages_.  (Perhaps it's because I'm a visual thinker. I'm not sure.). Anyway, one of my current targets is Pony (or Ponylang, but that feels a little less friendly).  I'm following the [tutorial], and looking at the [examples], as well as making extensive use of the awesome community over on Zulip.

I'll be blogging as I go, because I know I'm not the only one who needs things a little more spelled out than others.  Plus, blogging things, aside from paving a road for others to come behind me, helps me get the details straight in my head.  That's handy when you're slow of uptake like I am.
